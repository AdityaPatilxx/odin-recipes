# HTML Practice Project

This project serves as a practical application of the HTML concepts I have learned. It is designed to help me become more familiar with Git and GitHub. Although it's a basic project, it provides a solid foundation for understanding fundamental web development principles without the complexity of numerous moving parts.

Additionally, this project has allowed me to practice writing clear and concise commit messages, enhancing my skills in version control and collaboration.
